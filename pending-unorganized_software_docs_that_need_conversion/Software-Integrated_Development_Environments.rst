**Integrated Development Environments** (IDEs) are software which
integrate all the tools a programmer uses in developing code: editor,
debugger, profiler/instrumenter, compiler (if necessary), and
documentation access.

IDEs are very useful for the programmer, and are a great boost to
productivity.

-  They automate a lot of the repetitive chores for you, such as
   maintaining a logical directory structure, and generating makefiles.
-  It is not necessary to switch windows between debugger, editor, and
   running program.
-  Documentation may be accessed directly within the editor, e.g. you
   may get a contextual menu on any library function, and read its
   documentation within the IDE itself.
-  IDEs maintain a symbol reference of your code so that you may point
   at a function or variable in the editor, and pop up a contextual menu
   to go to the place where it is defined, even if it is in a separate
   file. This also allows the IDE to show you exactly where a particular
   symbol has been used anywhere within a project.
-  Current IDEs have `code
   refactoring <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring>`__
   capabilities.
-  They also have libraries of common design patterns.
-  Symbol name completions are also useful: type a few characters, and
   it will pop up a list of possible completions. Especially useful if
   you are using large libraries.
