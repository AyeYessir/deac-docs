`Category:Software </Category:Software>`__ **MayaVi** is a 3D
visualization tool maintained by Enthought. [1]_ It is part of the
Enthought Python Distribution. [2]_

To use MayaVi, load the EPD (Enthought Python Distribution) module:

``    module load epd-7.2-2``

Then, run by issuing the command:

``    mayavi2``

**N.B.** The EPD provides Python 2.7 (as opposed to the default Python
2.6.6 in RHEL6), and Python modules such as numpy. The EPD's version of
numpy is linked against Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) for optimized
performance.
