Versions
========

As of 1 December 2020, installed versions of MATLAB includes:

-  **MATLAB 2020a**
-  **MATLAB 2017a**
-  **MATLAB 2016a**

To use Matlab, load the appropriate
`module </Quick_Start_Guide:Environment_Modules>`__ with corresponding
version:

``    $ module load rhel7/matlab/2020a``

Licensing
=========

The MATLAB license for the DEAC Cluster is available for students,
faculty, and staff who are participating in coursework or research
requiring the DEAC cluster. The cluster license allows for up to 10,000
license checkouts for EVERY toolbox provided by MathWorks.

What that means:

:\* Everyone using Matlab must check out a **MATLAB** license, resulting
in a maximum of 10,000 Matlab processes that can be concurrently started
for research use.

:\* Toolboxes in MATLAB provide extra functionality. That functionality
requires a supplemental license checkout. The maximum number of
concurrent licenses for each toolbox are also 10,000.

:\* Each license check out is **PER SESSION**. So, one **person** on the
cluster submitting 1,000 MATLAB jobs would utilize 10% of the available
licenses available for the DEAC cluster.

Documentation
=============

MathWorks maintains reference material for the versions of Matlab that
we have installed. However, since they are not the most current ones,
the reference material is in Mathworks's archive. To access them, you
will need to register for an account at MathWorks using your @wfu.edu
email address.
